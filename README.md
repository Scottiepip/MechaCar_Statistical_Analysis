# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview:
Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, we are helping Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

  - Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
  - Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
  - Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
  - Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll
   write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG:

  - According to the result, vehicle_length and ground_clearance are providing non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
  - The slope of the linear model is not consider to be zero. The P-value for the other three variables, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD are all greater thean  0.05, it means that all these three variables have significant impact on mpg values.
