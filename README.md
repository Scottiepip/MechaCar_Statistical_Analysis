# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview:
Upper management had approached Jeremy about a special project. The Manufacturing Team of AutosRUs' newest prototype, the MechaCar, was experiencing production problems. Upper management at AutosRUs had asked Jeremy and his team to review the production data and find insights that will aid the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, we helped Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
